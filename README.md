## 🎯 Project Overview

Deploymate is a local deployment platform inspired by Vercel, built to simulate a complete CI/CD pipeline using modular services and real-time updates.
    

* **Microservice-based architecture**:

  * **Request Handler**: manages incoming HTTP requests and routes them
  * **Upload Service**: clones GitHub repositories and queues builds
  * **Deploy Service**: builds the cloned project and stores the artifacts
  * **Serve/Proxy Layer**: serves the built assets using Cloudflare infrastructure

---

## ⚙️ Core Technologies

* **Cloudflare** — used for hosting and serving the final build output via object storage and CDN
* **Redis** — powers Pub/Sub messaging and queuing between services
* **Node.js / TypeScript** — handles backend logic for uploading, deploying, and request routing
* **Frontend (React)** — provides an interactive UI to trigger deployments and monitor build status

---

## 🧩 System Architecture & Flow

1. **User submits a GitHub repository link** via the frontend dashboard.
2. **Upload Service** clones the repo and adds a job to a **Redis queue**.
3. **Deploy Service** picks up the job, builds the project (e.g., using Vite or Webpack).
4. The built output is **uploaded to Cloudflare** (R2 or Pages) and linked to a custom or autogenerated subdomain.
5. **Request Handler** proxies requests to the correct Cloudflare-hosted project.
6. **Redis Pub/Sub** sends real-time build and deployment updates to the frontend UI.

## 🔍 Why It Matters

* Implements a **scalable microservice architecture** separating upload, build, and serve concerns
* Uses **Cloudflare** for low-latency, cost-effective deployment and delivery
* Demonstrates real-world DevOps patterns using Redis, containerized services, and reactive UIs
* Enables hands-on learning of deployment workflows, CI/CD automation, and web infrastructure

## ✅ Summary

This project simulates a real-world deployment platform with the following capabilities:

* GitHub repo cloning
* Build orchestration and artifact generation
* Cloudflare-based hosting and delivery
* Real-time deployment status updates
* Web proxying to serve user-deployed applications
